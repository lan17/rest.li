/**
 * Annotations WITHIN recursive schema should not contain cyclic referencing otherwise it would never end
 * As a user, one needs to manually expand the schema, instead of using cyclic reference, in this case.
 *
 * Reasoning: The moment applied recursive referencing in pathSpec, recursive records carried over
 * this recursively. If we don't allow a cyclic pointer to form a loop, it will never end.
 * If we form a loop, then inside the schema, resolved properties lost layer information (essentially fisrt layer equivalent to Nth layer)
